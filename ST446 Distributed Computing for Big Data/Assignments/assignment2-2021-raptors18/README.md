> **Important**:  Please note that you _must_ submit a solution for this coursework assessment. A failure to do this will result in a Zero Incomplete grade, and hence an overall fail of the course.

This assignment consists of four parts. Each part is worth 25/100 marks.

* P1: [Querying the YAGO semantic knowledge base](hw_yago_local.ipynb)
* P2: [Spark streaming of tweets](hw_tweet.ipynb)
* P3: [Topic modelling for DBLP](hw_dblp.ipynb)
* P4: [Optimisation methods](opt_questions.pdf)

**Please do not wait until the last minute to do this assignment.**
As some of the input data is of large volume, some of the code may take a long time to run.

Please let us know if you run out of GCP credits.
